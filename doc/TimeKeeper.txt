2. Description                                   *TimeKeeper-description*

This plugin will keep track of the time spent in the editor. It will
try and workout how much time is being spent on the current activity.
It will allocate the time that is spent on the current task. It also will
add notes to the repository if the repository will allow this.

For details on the changes between versions see |TimeKeeper-history|.

==============================================================================
3. Usage                                         *TimeKeeper-usage*

TimeKeeper will track the time that you spend in Vim. It will store this time
in a comma separated value (CSV) file.

The TimeKeeper plugin does not start recording time until you call the start
recording function:

    call TimeKeeper_StartTracking()

If this is the first time that you have called TimeKeeper it will ask you
can it create the file. You can change the location of the file, but you then
must tell TimeKeeper where this is. You can do this in your .vimrc by setting
the |g:TimeKeeperFilename| variable to where the file is.

After this the tracking is automatic and this file will be updated regularly.

Also, after you have started timetracking at least once, then you can set the
configuration flag |g:TimeKeeperStartOnLoad| to 1 and it will cause the 
TimeKeeper to start as soon as it can.

TimeKeeper uses the |clientserver| functions in vim to allow for instances of
vim to talk to each other. This will allow for the time to be updated safely
without two difference instances overwritting the others tracked time. TimeKeeper
works out which instance should be master and handles the writing to the file 
and will handle the master instance disappearing.

TimeKeeper uses the vim auto |CursorHold| and |CursorMove| (and a couple others)
to handle the tracking. What the CursorHold does is to fire an event when the
cursor has not moved for 'updatetime' ms. It then uses the CursorMove event 
to know when you started typing again. If the start-end time is with then 
away time then this time is added (as well as the time you spent typing) to the
total time you have been working. If this time is greater then this time is
thrown away as it assumes you where doing other things and the time should 
not be tracked. These times are configurable.

Note: that as the tracking is only done when you stop typing for 'updatetime'
ms (which currently defaults to 4 seconds) the update is only done periodically.
The update could have been done on every cursor move, but this slowed down the
editor on slower laptops (which I am owner of one - and it will be removed
from my cold dead hands). 

If you are using Git and have not changed the |g:TimeKeeperUseGitProjectBranch|
variable to 0, then the current job will default to the current branch and the
current project will default the directory name that the repository is in. Also
if you have left |g:TimeKeeperUseGitNotes| turned on then TimeKeeper will
also write the time of the current job to a 'timekeeper' gitnote. This will
be accessible to other software that can read the git notes on from the repository.
You should remember to push these notes if you want then to be seen globally.

The format of the gitnote will be:
>
	<user_email>,<project_name>.<job_name>#days:hours:minutes
<
The gitnotes will be added to the CURRENT commit so there will be a history of
the time it took on the previous gitnotes for the commits. This how gitnotes
works, and maybe useful. But, the last commit will have the TOTAL time that
TimeKeeper thinks that you have used. It might be wise to use different id's
on different machines, or use local TimeKeeper files that you can commit to
the repository so that these times can stay conistant. 

The TimeKeeper will stop tracking time (obviously) when the editor closes and
it will update all on close. If you want to stop tracking time manually then
you simply have to call the following function:

    call TimeKeeper_StopTracking()

==============================================================================
4. Useful TimeKeeper Functions                      *TimeKeeper-functions*

There is only three function that are useful outside of the TimeKeeper and
these functions are:

TimeKeeper_StartTracking()							*TimeKeeper_StartTracking()*
		This function simple starts the tracking. It will handle all the file
		creation and set that is required. This function should only be called
		once preferably by the .vimrc startup script. If it is called after the
		time-tracking is started, it will throw away any time that has not
		been written to the file. It will not leave the system inconsistent as
		it reads the current time from the timesheet before it starts tracking
		any time.

TimeKeeper_StopTracking()							*TimeKeeper_StopTracking()*
		This function stops the tracking. It will flush the data to the file and
		call the gitnote update function.

TimeKeeper_GetCurrentJobString()					*TimeKeeper_GetCurrentJobString()*
		This function will return a string that will that contains the current
		project,job and the time in days:hours:mins. This can be used on the
		statusline to let you know what job the editor thinks you are on and
		how much time you have spent on it.

==============================================================================
5. Configuration									*TimeKeeper-configuration*

The following are the globals that are used to configure the way that timekeeper
handles the tracking of time. The default is in square brackets.

g:TimeKeeperAwayTimeSec	         					*g:TimeKeeperAwayTimeSec*
		If the user does not type for this amount of time it is assumed that
		they were away from the keyboard and the time is not registered. [360]

g:TimeKeeperDefaultProject							*g:TimeKeeperDefaultProject*
		The default project to add time to ['default']

g:TimeKeeperDefaultJob								*g:TimeKeeperDefaultJob*
		The default job to add time to ['default']

g:TimeKeeperUpdateFileTimeSec						*g:TimeKeeperUpdateFileTimeSec*
		The frequency that the timesheet file will be updated. [60 * 15 - 15 mins]

g:TimeKeeperUseLocal								*g:TimeKeeperUseLocal*
		If this flag is set then the timekeeper will create a file at the cwd of
		the editor. If your vim has been compiled without |clientserver| then this
		will default to 1. [0]

g:TimeKeeperFileName								*g:TimeKeeperFileName*
		The filename that the timesheet will be saved to. [(.)timekeeper.tmk] 

g:TimeKeeperUseGitProjectBranch						*g:TimeKeeperUseGitProjectBranch*
		If vim is in a git repository use the directory name as the project name
		and the branch name as the job name. [1]

g:TimeKeeperUseGitNotes								*g:TimeKeeperUseGitNotes*
		If this flag is set then timekeeper will create a gitnote in the current
		branch if the editor is in a git repository. It will create a gitnote with the
		ref of you guessed it "timekeeper". It will try and keep the entries separate
		as it will use the user.email as the key for the entries. [0]

g:TimeKeeperGitNoteUpdateTimeSec					*g:TimeKeeperGitNoteUpdateTimeSec*
		The time that the git notes will be updated this is not that important as it
		re-writes the gitnote, but will cause you git history to get quite large if you
		update the notes too frequently. [60 * 60]

g:TimeKeeperStartOnLoad								*g:TimeKeeperStartOnLoad*
Start the TimeKeeper on vim load, this should not be done before the default file has
been created by running the start.

If you are using the git-hooks the following environment variables can be set
to change the way that they behave, they do not need to be set as the defaults
are sensible.

TIMEKEEPER_DONT_TRACK	[0]							*TIMEKEEPER_DONT_TRACK*
If this is set to 1, then the commit time will not be added to the end of the
commit message. 

TIMEKEEPER_TIMESHEET	[""]						*TIMEKEEPER_TIMESHEET*
If you have changed g:TimeKeeperFileName this variable should be set to match,
the sensible way to handle this would be to set this value and in the .vimrc
set g:TimeKeeperFileName to this value, i.e.:

    let gt:TimeKeeperFileName = $TIMEKEEPER_TIMESHEET

This value does not need to be set.

TIMEKEEPER_ISSUE_ID		[""]						*TIMEKEEPER_ISSUE_ID*
If you have not mangled your branch names to add the issue number to the end
you can set the issue number using this variable. You need to place the issue
id in this variable in the format that is requires. For Redmine the format
should be:

    export TIMEKEEPER_ISSUE_ID="#499"

This will then add the message as detailed below.

==============================================================================
6. Git Integration                               *TimeKeeper-git-integration*

There are two git hooks included with the TimeKeeper system, a
`prepare-commit-msg` hook and a `post-commit` hook. These hooks will
add the time elapsed between commits to the commit.

The prepare-commit-msg will write the time elasped between the total-time
and the last time the commit was done. The last commit-time is updated when
the post-commit hook is run. So it is only updated when the commit completes.

The prepare-commit-msg will add the minutes since the last commit was done.

Some random minutes may go missing - rounding errors, but this is not
that accurate a system, you probably need something else if you really
need seconds accuracy.

The hook can also add a reference to the current job_id number if the branch
name is correctly formatted. If the branch name is formatted as follows:

    branch_name#499

with the job_id == 499, this will produce the following at the bottom
of the commit:

   refs #499 @12h49

If you don't/can't add the issue number to the end if the branch name you can set
the |TIMEKEEPER_ISSUE_ID| variable and it will do the same thing. This will allow
for your time tracking app to pick this up. If it does not have the issue id set
then the following will be added to the commit:

   (project_name.job_name#45312334#46140)

which is the total project time in seconds, followed by the number of
seconds since the last commit. So the time is still tracked in the
repository, you can use this as you see fit to update your time tracking.

Also it will only update the time if the timekeeper file is read/writable to
it can update it at the end and stop adding the same time over again.

To set up the Git hooks you will need to do the following in the root directory of the git
repository.

    ln -s ~/.vim/githooks/prepare-commit-msg .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg
    ln -s ~/.vim/githooks/post-commit .git/hooks/post-commit

On Windows (not tested) you will need to copy them into hooks directory.

The above assumes you have these plugins installed locally, else you will need to amend the
source of the plugin, also it assumes that you don't already have these hooks, if you do then
you will need to integrate these with your current hooks. I assume just adding:

   .sh ~/.vim/githooks/prepare-commit-msg $1 $2 $3 

to the end of your current prepare-commit-msg (and do similar for post) will do the job you
need.
